	/* Queue Reconstruction by Height - Sort & Insertion:
	 * Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), 
	 * where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater 
	 * than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

	/*
	 * Solution: Sort+Insert solution
	 * 	- We first sort the people to make them stand from the highest to shortest. For people with same height, sort them according to the 
	 *    count of people before them from small to big.
	 *  - Then, we use the way similar to insert sorting to reorder the people. For a given person to insert, all the people already sorted 
	 *    are higher, so we just insert him in the "right" place to make the people before him as his "count" indicates. Since he is shorter
	 *    than all the people in the sorted list, the "count" of the "existing" people does not be broken by the insertion.
	 *  Time Complexity: O(nlogn)+O(n^2)

	/* Patching Array:

	 * in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of 
	 * patches required.
	 * Input: nums = [1,3], n = 6; Output: 1
	 * Input: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20; Output: 2

	/* Solution:
	 * 	Sample: {1,3}, n=6 => When you add 2 to arr, will get all the numbers from 1 to 6 in arr {1,2,3}. like [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
	 *  Sample: {1,5,10}, n=20 => When you add 2, 4, will get all the numbers from 1 to 20 in arr {1,2,4,5,10}
	 *  Intuition here is, 
	 *  	1     -> It has range from 1 to n;  where n is sum of all nums. here n is 1.
	 *      1,2   -> covers from 1 to n; here n is 3;
	 *      1,2,4 -> covers from 1 to n; here n is 7;
	 *      1,2,4,8 -> covers from 1 to n; here n is 15;
